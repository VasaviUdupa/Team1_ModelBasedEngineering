### **Overview of the Computer, Camera, and Computer Vision Components**  

---

## **1. Computer (Central Processing Unit)**
**Purpose:**  
The Computer is the core processing unit that manages data from the Camera and Computer Vision AI, processes food information, and sends recommendations to the user.

**Key Functions:**
- Collects data from Camera and Sensors.  
- Processes food inventory updates.  
- Runs AI models for recipe suggestions.  
- Stores data in local memory or cloud.  
- Connects with smart home devices like Alexa, Google Home, or a mobile app.

**Key Attributes:**
- **Processor:** Handles AI and food recognition tasks.  
- **Storage:** Stores inventory and meal history.  
- **Network Connectivity:** Communicates with cloud-based services.  
- **Power Management:** Optimizes performance based on workload.  

**Data Flow:**
1. Receives food images from the Camera.  
2. Validates and processes data using AI.  
3. Stores results in the local database or cloud.  
4. Sends recipe recommendations to the user interface.

## **2. Camera (Image Capture System)**
**Purpose:**  
The Camera is responsible for capturing images of food items placed inside the refrigerator and sending them to the Computer Vision system for identification.

**Key Functions:**
- Detects food placement and removal in the fridge.  
- Captures high-resolution images for food recognition.  
- Stores images in local memory or cloud.  
- Streams live images to the Computer Vision for processing.

**Key Attributes:**
- **Resolution:** Defines image quality, such as 4K or 1080p.  
- **Frame Rate:** Captures images in real-time.  
- **Sensor Type:** Uses CMOS or CCD sensors.  
- **Storage:** Saves images locally or on the cloud.  

**Data Flow:**
1. Detects food placement using sensors.  
2. Captures an image of the stored food.  
3. Sends the image to the Computer Vision system for processing.

## **3. Computer Vision (AI-Based Food Recognition)**
**Purpose:**  
The Computer Vision system uses AI-based object detection to recognize food items from images captured by the Camera.

**Key Functions:**
- Identifies food items using machine learning models.  
- Classifies food based on type, brand, and freshness.  
- Provides structured data to the Computer for further processing.  
- Continuously improves accuracy using cloud-based AI updates.

**Key Attributes:**
- **AI Model:** Uses YOLO, MobileNet, or custom-trained models for recognition.  
- **Accuracy:** Ensures high food detection accuracy.  
- **Processing Speed:** Analyzes images in real time.  
- **Network Connectivity:** Updates AI models from the cloud.  

**Data Flow:**
1. Receives food images from the Camera.  
2. Preprocesses images (resizing, filtering).  
3. Detects objects and classifies food items.  
4. Sends structured food data to the Computer for processing.
