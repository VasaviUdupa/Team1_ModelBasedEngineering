Value stream analysis
1. Scope & Goal: From the user being hungry wanting to consume the meal, to using the smart fridge for inventory and recipe suggestions. 
Goal: Identify potential waste and improve efficiency in meal planning and preparation.
2. Current State Value Stream Map:
●	Trigger: User decides to make a meal. (Time: 1 minute - Value-Adding)
●	Inventory Check (Manual): User opens fridge, visually checks for ingredients. (Time: 3 minutes - Non-Value-Adding, Motion, Potential Defect: Inaccurate assessment)
●	Recipe Idea Generation (Manual): User considers possible meals based on perceived ingredients. (Time: 5 minutes - Non-Value-Adding, Waiting, Potential Defect: Limited options)
●	Smart Fridge Inventory Check: User interacts with fridge to confirm available ingredients. (Time: 2 minutes - Value-Adding, Information Flow)
●	Recipe Search (Fridge): User requests recipe suggestions from fridge based on available ingredients. (Time: 1 minute - Value-Adding, Information Flow)
●	Recipe Selection: User reviews suggestions and selects a recipe. (Time: 2 minutes - Value-Adding)
●	Ingredient Gathering: User gathers ingredients from fridge and pantry. (Time: 5 minutes - Non-Value-Adding, Motion)
●	Meal Preparation: User prepares the meal. (Time: 30 minutes - Value-Adding)
●	Consumption: User eats the meal. (Time: 20 minutes - Value-Adding)
Current State Metrics:
●	Total Process Time: 69 minutes
●	Value-Adding Time: 34 minutes (49%)
●	Non-Value-Adding Time: 35 minutes (51%)
●	Key Waste: Motion (ingredient gathering), Waiting (recipe idea generation), Defects (inaccurate inventory assessment, limited recipe options)
3. Analysis of Current State:
●	Bottleneck: Ingredient gathering and manual recipe idea generation are time-consuming.
●	Waste: Significant motion and waiting time. Potential for inaccurate inventory assessment and limited recipe options due to manual steps.
4. Future State Value Stream Map:
●	Trigger: User decides to make a meal. (Time: 1 minute - Value-Adding)
●	Smart Fridge Inventory Check: User interacts with fridge to confirm available ingredients. (Time: 2 minutes - Value-Adding, Information Flow)
●	Recipe Search (Fridge): User requests recipe suggestions from fridge based on available ingredients, including soon-to-expire items. (Time: 1 minute - Value-Adding, Information Flow)
●	Recipe Selection: User reviews suggestions, filtered by dietary needs and preparation time, and selects a recipe. (Time: 1 minute - Value-Adding)
●	Ingredient Gathering (Optimized): Fridge displays a list of required ingredients with their location in the fridge/pantry (if integrated). (Time: 2 minutes - Non-Value-Adding, Motion Reduced)
●	Meal Preparation: User prepares the meal. (Time: 30 minutes - Value-Adding)
●	Consumption: User eats the meal. (Time: 20 minutes - Value-Adding)
Future State Metrics:
●	Total Process Time: 57 minutes
●	Value-Adding Time: 34 minutes (59%)
●	Non-Value-Adding Time: 23 minutes (41%)
●	Key Improvements: Reduced motion and waiting time. Improved recipe suggestions.
5. Implementation Plan:
Action 1: Enhance fridge software to include ingredient location tracking (if feasible).
●	Responsible Party: Software Engineering Team
●	Timeline: 3 months
●	Metrics: Reduction in ingredient gathering time (minutes).
Action 2: Improve recipe suggestion algorithm to consider dietary needs, preparation time, and soon-to-expire ingredients.
●	Responsible Party: Software Engineering Team
●	Timeline: 2 months
●	Metrics: User satisfaction with recipe suggestions (survey). Number of meals made with soon-to-expire ingredients.
Action 3: User training/onboarding for new fridge features.
●	Responsible Party: Marketing/User Experience Team
●	Timeline: 1 month (concurrent with software development)
●	Metrics: User adoption of new features.
