NLP Analysis 
This smart fridge aims to reduce food waste and improve user nutrition through inventory tracking and recipe suggestions. NLP plays a crucial role in understanding user needs, interpreting food data, and generating relevant recommendations.
NLP Functionality:
1.	Groceries Item Recognition:
○	Image Recognition & OCR: The fridge uses cameras to capture images of items placed inside. Machine Learning models extracts text from packaging (e.g., product names, expiration dates).
○	NLP for Item Categorization: NLP is used to standardize item names,  categorize items into dairy, vegetables, fruits etc., and identify variations (e.g., "oat milk," "2% milk," "almond milk").
○	Expiration Date Extraction & Parsing: NLP extracts expiration dates from packaging text and converts them into a standardized date format.
2.	User Interaction & Recipe Search:
○	Natural Language Understanding (NLU): NLU interprets user queries, identifies intents (e.g., recipe search, inventory check), and extracts relevant entities (e.g., ingredient names, expiration dates).
○	Recipe Retrieval & Filtering: NLP searches a recipe database and generates a suitable recipe recommendation list based on available ingredients and user preferences (e.g., dietary restrictions, cuisine types).
○	Recipe Summarization & Key Ingredient Highlight: NLP can summarize lengthy recipes and highlight key ingredients from the fridge inventory providing a high level summary of time needed to prepare, quantity of ingredients and nutrition value.
3.	Nutrition Analysis & Personalized Recommendations:
○	Ingredient Nutrition Data Extraction: NLP retrieves nutritional information for each ingredient from a database.
○	Meal Nutrition Analysis: NLP calculates the overall nutritional value of suggested recipes.
○	Personalized Dietary Recommendations: NLP analyzes user dietary preferences and health goals (if provided) to suggest recipes that meet their needs.
○	Food waste impact analysis: NLP can provide information on how much waste is being reduced.
4.	Feedback and Learning:
○	Sentiment Analysis: NLP analyzes user reviews and feedback to identify areas for improvement.
○	User Preference Learning: NLP tracks user interactions (e.g., recipes viewed, ingredients used) to learn their preferences and improve future recommendations.
Analytics and Performance Metrics:
1. User Satisfaction:
●	Performance:
○	Positive sentiment percentage.
○	Average rating.
●	Analytics:
○	Reviews: Sentiment analysis of user reviews (e.g., app store, in-app feedback) to gauge overall satisfaction.
○	In-app Surveys: Gathering quantitative and qualitative feedback on specific features.
2. Cost Savings (Food Wastage):
●	Analytics:
○	% Food Past Expiration: Tracking the percentage of food items that expire before being consumed.
○	Amount of food saved: Tracking the calculated weight or value of food that was used before expiration due to the system.
●	Performance:
○	Reduction in food waste percentage.
○	Dollar value of food saved.
3. Recommendations Followed:
●	Analytics:
○	% Meal the User Follow the Input: Tracking the percentage of suggested recipes that users actually cook.
○	Ingredient usage percentage: tracking the amount of ingredients used from the fridge.
●	Performance:
○	Recipe adoption rate.
○	Ingredient usage rate.
4. Cost of System:
●	Analytics:
○	COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): Tracking the cost of hardware, software, and manufacturing.
●	Performance:
○	Unit cost.
5. Time Savings to User:
●	Analytics:
○	Average time of recipe: tracking the average recipe cook time.
○	Time spent on meal planning and grocery list creation before and after using the fridge.
●	Performance:
○	Reduction in meal planning and grocery list creation time.
○	Average recipe preparation time.
6. Recurring Revenue:
●	Analytics:
○	USD: Tracking revenue from subscriptions, premium features, or partnerships.
●	Performance:
○	Monthly/annual recurring revenue.
○	Customer retention rate.
7. Operating Time (Reliability):
●	Analytics:
○	Support call/connectivity: Tracking the number of support calls related to connectivity or functionality issues.
○	System uptime: tracking the amount of time the system is functioning correctly.
●	Performance:
○	System uptime percentage.
○	Number of support tickets.
○	Connectivity reliability.
How Analytics Will Be Performed:
●	Data Collection: Gathering data from the fridge sensors, user interactions, and feedback platforms.
●	Data Processing: Cleaning, standardizing, and aggregating the collected data.
●	Data Analysis: Using statistical and NLP techniques to analyze the data and extract insights.
●	Reporting & Visualization: Presenting the analysis results in clear and concise reports and visualizations.
●	A/B Testing: implementing and tracking A/B testing of various features and algorithms.
By continuously monitoring and analyzing these metrics, the smart fridge system can be optimized to improve user experience, reduce food waste, and promote healthier eating habits.
