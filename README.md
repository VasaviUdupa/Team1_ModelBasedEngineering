The Smart Home Kitchen will also have to have a level of autonomy so that the end user does not feel using the features is a burden.

The Smart Home Kitchen will use computer vision to track the food when it is placed in fridge and taken out. This will allow for the creation of a manifest of current food in the fridge so the nutritional makeup and expiration date can be known. The Smart Home Kitchen will then use this information with an LLM to provide a list of suggested meals to optimize food wastage, nutrition, and reduction in meal planning stress.
