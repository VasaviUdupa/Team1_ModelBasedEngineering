### **1. Food Tracking & Inventory Management**
#### **Food Tracking Accuracy Test**
**GIVEN** food items are placed in the refrigerator with known inventory levels.  
**WHEN** the system scans and detects food items.  
**THEN** the system correctly identifies all food items with **95%+ accuracy**.

#### **Expiring Ingredients Prioritization Test**
**GIVEN** some ingredients in the refrigerator **are nearing expiration**.  
**WHEN** the system generates recipe suggestions.  
**THEN** the system **prioritizes the use of ingredients that will expire soon**, reducing food waste.

#### **Low Stock Notification Trigger**
**GIVEN** stock levels are monitored for multiple food items.  
**WHEN** a food item’s **quantity drops below the set threshold**.  
**THEN** the system **sends a notification to the user** alerting them of the low stock.

### **2. Recipe Suggestions & AI Performance**
#### **Recipe Suggestion Evaluation**
**GIVEN** a database of recipes and food ingredient mappings is available.  
**WHEN** the user selects available ingredients and requests a recipe.  
**THEN** the system suggests recipes that match available ingredients and **user preferences**.

#### **Dietary Restriction Compliance Test**
**GIVEN** the user has specified dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).  
**WHEN** the system suggests recipes based on available ingredients.  
**THEN** the suggested recipes **only include ingredients that comply with the user’s dietary restrictions**.

#### **Allergen Warning System Test**
**GIVEN** the user has a known **food allergy** (e.g., nuts, dairy, shellfish).  
**WHEN** the system suggests a recipe that includes an allergen.  
**THEN** the system **warns the user and suggests alternative recipes that do not contain the allergen**.


#### **Meal Balancing Test**
**GIVEN** the user wants a **balanced meal** (e.g., 40% carbs, 30% protein, 30% fat).  
**WHEN** the system generates a recipe suggestion.  
**THEN** the macronutrient distribution of the recipe **matches the user’s predefined dietary balance**.

### **3. Nutrition & Health Monitoring**
#### **Nutritional Value Accuracy Test**
**GIVEN** the system has access to a database of food nutrition information.  
**WHEN** the user requests **nutritional details** for a suggested recipe.  
**THEN** the system **displays accurate calorie, protein, fat, and carbohydrate counts per serving**.

#### **Calorie Limit Enforcement Test**
**GIVEN** the user has set a **maximum daily calorie intake**.  
**WHEN** the system suggests a meal plan for the day.  
**THEN** the total calorie count of all meals does **not exceed the user-defined limit**.

#### **Sugar Intake Monitoring Test**
**GIVEN** the user has set a **daily sugar intake limit**.  
**WHEN** a recipe contains **high amounts of sugar**.  
**THEN** the system **alerts the user and suggests a lower-sugar alternative**.

#### **Child Nutrition Compliance Test**
**GIVEN** a child’s age-specific nutritional needs (e.g., iron, calcium, vitamins).  
**WHEN** the system suggests a meal for the child.  
**THEN** the meal meets **the recommended daily intake for essential nutrients based on age**.

---

### **4. User Interface & Notifications**
#### **User Interface Responsiveness**
**GIVEN** the system UI is fully operational and connected to the backend.  
**WHEN** the user performs actions such as **inventory check, recipe search, or settings updates**.  
**THEN** UI response time remains **under 200ms** for all actions.

#### **Grocery Stock Alert Test**
**GIVEN** the inventory is at **50% capacity**, and stock alerts are enabled.  
**WHEN** the stock of a grocery item **falls below the threshold**.  
**THEN** the system **immediately notifies the user** about the low-stock item.

---

### **5. System Performance & Hardware Tests**
#### **Computer Processing Speed Test**
**GIVEN** the system has access to **historical processing data**.  
**WHEN** the system initiates a **food tracking and recipe generation process**.  
**THEN** the system processes **food tracking and recipe generation within 2 seconds**.

#### **Computer Vision Object Detection**
**GIVEN** food items with known characteristics are placed in front of the camera.  
**WHEN** the camera captures images and the **computer vision algorithm processes them**.  
**THEN** the computer vision model **classifies objects with 95%+ accuracy**.

#### **Camera Image Capture Quality**
**GIVEN** the camera is positioned at an optimal angle inside the refrigerator.  
**WHEN** the **refrigerator lighting conditions change** (bright, dim, or dark).  
**THEN** the captured images **maintain high quality and clarity**.

#### **Sensor Data Collection Accuracy**
**GIVEN** the sensors are **calibrated and installed correctly**.  
**WHEN** the **temperature and humidity levels change** inside the refrigerator.  
**THEN** the **sensor readings match expected values within ±1% accuracy**.

#### **System Power Consumption Analysis**
**GIVEN** the system is powered on and operating normally.  
**WHEN** the system is subjected to **intensive processing tasks** (multiple food tracking and recipe suggestions).  
**THEN** the **power consumption remains within expected operational limits**.
