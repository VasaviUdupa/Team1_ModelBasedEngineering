### **Safety Analysis for Smart Home Kitchen System**  

The **Smart Home Kitchen System** integrates **hardware (camera, sensors, computer vision)** and **software (LLM for recipe suggestions, UI, notifications)**. A comprehensive **safety analysis** ensures the system operates **reliably, securely, and minimizes risks** related to food safety, appliance failures, and user errors.  

---

## **1. Hazard Identification (HAZOP - Hazard and Operability Analysis)**  
The following are **potential hazards** in the system, categorized by **type of risk and impact**:  

| **Hazard Type**  | **Potential Hazard** | **Cause** | **Impact** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|------------|-------------------------|
| **Food Safety** | Expired food is consumed | System fails to detect expiration | Food poisoning, health risks | Improve expiration detection, send alerts sooner |
| **Food Safety** | Incorrect allergen detection | LLM fails to exclude allergenic ingredients | Severe allergic reactions | Strengthen allergen database and validation |
| **Electric Safety** | System overheating | Excessive power consumption | Fire hazard, system failure | Implement thermal monitoring and auto shutdown |
| **Hardware Failure** | Camera fails to detect food | Poor lighting, camera malfunction | Incorrect inventory, misleading stock alerts | Improve lighting, add redundant detection |
| **User Error** | User ignores expiration alerts | Notification overload, UI design issue | Food waste, potential illness | Prioritize and escalate critical notifications |
| **Cybersecurity** | Unauthorized access to system | Weak authentication, API vulnerability | Data leaks, remote tampering | Implement encryption, multi-factor authentication |
| **System Performance** | LLM suggests unhealthy recipes | Algorithm bias, missing nutritional constraints | Poor diet, overconsumption of calories | Enforce strict dietary constraints in AI model |
| **Physical Hazard** | System malfunctions and fridge door stays open | Sensor failure, UI notification failure | Spoiled food, energy waste | Implement redundant sensor checks |

## **2. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**  
This section **analyzes failures in components**, their **effects**, and **recommended actions**.  

| **Component** | **Failure Mode** | **Effect** | **Severity** (High/Med/Low) | **Mitigation** |
|--------------|----------------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Camera** | Image capture fails | System cannot track inventory | High | Implement backup detection (e.g., barcode scanning) |
| **Computer Vision** | Misclassifies food | Wrong ingredients in inventory | Medium | Improve AI model, retrain with diverse datasets |
| **LLM (Recipe AI)** | Suggests non-dietary-compliant meals | Violates user’s dietary restrictions | High | Strengthen constraints on dietary preferences |
| **Grocery Stock Monitoring** | Stock not updated in real-time | Users buy unnecessary items | Medium | Improve sync frequency between camera and database |
| **Notification System** | Alerts fail to trigger | Users unaware of expired food | High | Implement retry mechanisms, escalate urgent alerts |

## **3. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies**  
### **Risk Classification Based on Severity and Likelihood**  

| **Risk Type** | **Severity** | **Likelihood** | **Risk Level** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|--------------|------------|--------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Expired food consumed | High | Medium | **High** | Improve expiration alerts, UI emphasis on critical alerts |
| Unauthorized access | High | Low | **Medium** | Implement encryption, multi-factor authentication |
| Overheating | High | Medium | **High** | Thermal monitoring, system auto-shutdown |
| Misclassification of food | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | Retrain AI, add barcode/manual entry backup |
| Incorrect recipe suggestions | High | Low | **Medium** | Validate LLM recommendations with diet constraints |

---

## **4. Safety Requirements (OSHA & IEC 61508 Compliance)**
- **Food Safety Regulations Compliance:** Ensure compliance with **FDA food storage guidelines**.
- **Cybersecurity Best Practices:** Use **secure APIs, encrypted communications, and role-based access**.
- **Emergency Power Off Mechanism:** If the system detects overheating, implement **automatic power cutoff**.
- **User Alert Escalation:** If a **critical notification is ignored**, escalate with **audible and mobile alerts**.

---

## **5. Verification & Validation for Safety**
| **Verification Test** | **Objective** | **Expected Outcome** |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Food Expiration Tracking Test** | Verify if expired food triggers an alert | Alert is sent immediately to the user |
| **System Overheating Protection Test** | Ensure system shuts down at high temperatures | Automatic shutdown at **threshold temperature** |
| **Unauthorized Access Test** | Validate secure authentication | Only authorized users can access the system |
| **LLM Recipe Validation Test** | Ensure dietary compliance | Recipes follow **user-defined preferences** |
| **Camera Failure Test** | Check system behavior when camera fails | System falls back to manual entry mode |
